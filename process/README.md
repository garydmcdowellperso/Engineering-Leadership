# Process

### :woman:- People, Process, Systems -

Whilst [organisation](../organisation/README.md) focuses on culture and people and [resources](../resources/README.md) and tooling focuses on systems, you cannot forget the processes that underpin your team / company.

Largely people talk about Agile at this point - our process is Agile but this can mean different things to different people and ultilately to the organisation.

It's also worth noting that Agile has nothing necessarily to do with how you get your software from development to production in terms of the steps you need to take - the physical doing - that's process.
