# Engineering Leadership

### :page_facing_up: - Description -

This is a curated list of materials, tools and advice for seasoned or aspiring Engineering Leaders.

It's deliberately not targetted only at Engineering Managers or any specific titles because as we know, titles are one thing, what you're doing is another!

I make no apology for the use of British English in these pages :smiley:

### :notebook_with_decorative_cover: - Contributors -

This is an open source project so as usual, there are a number of people to thank for their contributions - if you want to reach out to them personally, some of them will be more than happy to help further on your journey!

A big thank you to them all
<br />

### :cd: - Where to start ? -

Well that's a little up to you :smiley: the repository itself should be fairly self explanatory in it's layout and each folder has its own README dedicated to that topic. 

|- [organisation](/organisation/README.md)
|- [process](/process/README.md)
|- [reading](/reading/README.md)
|- [resources](/resources/README.md)
|- [tooling](/tooling/README.md)


### :rocket: - Motivation -

There are a lot of good sources of information on the internet but they appears appear to be quite spread out or unless you capture the moment, they can pass you by e.g. Twitter.

So the motivation was / is to centralise as much as possible where you can get access to all this good information no matter when you join the party!

### :computer: - Become a contributor -

Don't hesitate to reach out, raise an issue or to become a contributor, the more the merrier
