### :house:- Your Team / Company and Culture -

It's not all about coding - there I said it. In fact a large part of a high performing and good place to work is around the way people are treated and the culture that you are trying to develop.

Do people feel rewarded and fulfilled in the roles. Do they understand the company objectives and how it applies to their team and themselves.

Do people feel like pawns or players ? Are they learning and developing or just 'doing a job' ?
